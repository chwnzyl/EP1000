            <p>Hello, I am Cheryl Ng from <i>DBT/FT/2A/01</i> (CLS). My 2 favourite hobbies are eating and watching kdramas, who's with me? Instead of choosing an elective related to my course, I wanted to try something more hands-on, especially since I am a huge fan of D&T and a bit of Physics since secondary school. Can't wait to try the equipment in FabLab!</p>
            <p>Let me take you through the world of <i>Digital Fabrication and Prototyping Fundamentals</i>. Below are some links to the topics that I will be learning/ have learnt in this semester, alternatively you can find them in the navigation panel.</p>
